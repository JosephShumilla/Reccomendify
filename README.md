# Getting Started
First, ensure you have installed the dependencies required to run the python program. The dependencies are stored in *requirements.txt*. To do so, install all files to a directory on your computer. Then, open a terminal in that directory and simply use

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure you have all dependencies.

*Note: We used this dataset to trim down to around 10,000 songs which each contain 15 columns, creating 150,000 datapoints, this method was used because performing the required operations on 15,000,000+ datapoints was not feasible*
